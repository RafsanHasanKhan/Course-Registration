# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


- Add at least 3 Project features

- At First, When I clicked the select button it added items to the sidebar area.
- Then When I click again the same button it will not add the same items. and Then it will show an alert message.
- The third feature was "Credit Hour Remaining 0 hr" and "Total Credit Hour : 20" calculation part. When the hours are over 20 hours It will show me an alert message. and When the hour Remaining will be under 0 hours then it will show me an alert message.

- Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

- Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project. The state is a very complicated area. I have tried a lot to use this state and I have succeeded. But I can't explain about state properly at this moment. I am really sorry for this reason. But I hope I will learn more about it soon. Thank you
